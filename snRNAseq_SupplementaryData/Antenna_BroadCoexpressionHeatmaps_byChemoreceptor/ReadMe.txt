Genes that appear above threshold in over 100 cells were selected from the neuron population and reclustered to visualize co-expression patterns. 
Genes with 100 cells or less are visualized according to the their cluster assignments from the entire neuron population.

For lower expressed genes, some genes were not scaled and do not appear in heatmaps. The heatmaps for these chemoreceptors are not included.
